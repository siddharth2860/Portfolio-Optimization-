This project focuses on building a portfolio optimization model using mean-variance optimization techniques in Python. The goal is to create an optimal portfolio allocation that maximizes the risk-return trade-off using historical stock data.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment and utilizes various Python libraries such as yfinance for downloading FnO stock data from Yahoo Finance. The portfolio optimization process involves the following steps:

1. Data Acquisition: FnO stock data is downloaded from Yahoo Finance using the yfinance library. The data includes historical stock prices and other relevant financial metrics.

2. Stock Selection: A list of all available stocks is obtained, and a random selection of 10 stocks is made. These stocks will be used to construct the portfolio.

3. Random Weight Assignment: Random weights are assigned to each stock in the portfolio. This helps create diverse portfolios with different risk exposures.

4. Portfolio Generation: 3000 portfolios are generated by assigning different random weights to the selected stocks. Each portfolio represents a unique combination of asset allocations.

5. Risk-Return Analysis: For each portfolio, the risk, return, and Sharpe ratio are calculated. The Sharpe ratio is a measure of the risk-adjusted return and helps identify the optimal portfolio.

6. Portfolio Selection: The portfolio with the maximum Sharpe ratio is selected as the optimal portfolio. This portfolio represents the best risk-return trade-off among all the generated portfolios.

7. Asset Allocation: Using the weights from the optimal portfolio, the amount of money to allocate to each stock is determined. The number of shares to buy is also calculated based on the available capital.

8. Performance Evaluation: The last year's stock price is used as the buy price, and the current price is used as the selling price. This information is used to calculate the absolute and percent returns of each stock and the overall portfolio.

9. Visualization: The project includes a graph that plots the normalized stock prices of the selected stocks. This helps visualize the historical performance of each stock.

10. Scatter Plot: A scatter plot is created with the x-axis representing risk and the y-axis representing return. The portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio and lowest risk is highlighted in the scatter plot.
